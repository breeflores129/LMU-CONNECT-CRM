# LMU-CONNECT-CRM

## Project Overview 
Implement a Salesforce CRM data pipeline to bridge the gap between current ISBA students and alumni, with an emphasis on retrieving pre-2018 alumni data, for enhanced career support and networking.

## Problem Statement 
  There is inadequate career and internship support and students are unable to easily connect with ISBA alumni in a physical space. 
  Online networking events have tried to solve this issue but it can be difficult for students to fully connect as there are many other students trying to get their time as well. Therefore, students can be left feeling helpless, unsure if alumni will follow through with mentoring and providing opportinuites, or overall remain confused on how to grow their network. 


## ISBA Subfields
#### ISBA Students 
- Willing and eager to form conenctions with alumni

#### ISBA/AIMS/ISQM ALumni
- Must stay connected with LMU and actively seek opportunities for current students

#### ISBA Faculty
- Create mentorship programs, events and workshops to introduce current students to alumni
